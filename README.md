# mangaplus-downloader
Python script to download the latest chapter of a specified manga from Manga Plus. Automation is done by setting script on a cron job.
What the script does:
1. Download the latest chapter of a manga on Manga Plus
2. Rename the file to match normal convention
3. Rsync the file to remote server where all other manga is stored
4. Delete file from host machine
5. Sends a message on Discord via webhook when the transfer is done, or if an error was encountered

## Virtual environment creation (if you don't already know) 
1. Install python3-full
```
sudo apt install python3-full
```
2. Make  the virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
```
3. Activate the venv
```
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
```
4. Finally, install dependencies
```
pip install python-dotenv mloader
```

## Dependencies
```
pip install python-dotenv mloader
```

## Usage
create a file _something_.env and fill with the following. The _something_ should be the name of the manga you want. You will store multiple env files, each for a specific manga you'd like to retireve.
```
MANGA_NAME=
MANGA_ID=
DOWNLOAD_DIR=manga_downloads
REMOTE_HOST=
REMOTE_USER=
REMOTE_DIR=
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=
```
When running the script you must pass the env file as an argument like so
```
python main.py --env something.env
```
## Wrapper script & scheduling a cron job
Because of virtual environment BS, we use a wrapper bash script to run the python script for us. In this script I'm specifying Dandadan.
```
cd
cd /path/to/main.py
venv/bin/python3 main.py --env Dandadan.env
```
Automate this script using a cron job.
Here is an example that runs every Sunday at 11:10am
```
10 11 * * 0 manga_downloader.sh
```
